# 📝 Blog API

A simple RESTful Blog API built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MySQL**, designed as my **first backend project**. It includes user authentication, blog management, and a one-to-many relationship between users and blog posts. The API was tested with Postman, and the database was structured using an ERD and mapping tables.
